# abelian-sandpile-model (SOC) – SAS Implementation

This project presents an implementation of the Abelian Sandpile modelan example of self-organized criticality in complex systems.

Content of the project:
- **Code (SAS, proc iml)** of the sandpile model 
- **LaTeX report (pdf)** describing the theoretical background, model properties and applications
- **3D visualization (png)** 

The model simulates the gradual addition of sand grains at the center of a grid and their redistribution through local toppling rules when a critical threshold is exceeded. Over time, the system naturally reaches a critical state characterized by avalanches of all sizes, illustrating scale invariance and power-law behavior.

Beyond its physical interpretation (avalanches, earthquakes), the sandpile model is discussed as a conceptual framework for complex systems, with applications in econophysics and financial market dynamics.
